          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>To begin, define which CIs will be supported. Think of this as the CMDB schema. 
              This can be changed and updated over time, it defines the types of CIs that may be recorded, as well as
              relationships between. This prevents incorrect relationships, such as assigned a software license to a server 
              rack.</p>
            <p>The blueprint defines what CIs can be stored in the CMDB and how they can be related</p>


          <h3>Multiple Inheritance</h3>
          <p>Objects can extend other objects. For example, any device that goes into a server rack may need to record:
              number of Rack Units (RU), Rack position, and power consumption (kW). Rather than define these attributes on
              every rackable device (Class), define a base class "_Rackable" (set instantiable=false, the leading underscore tells us
              this object should never be instantiated) and add the properties to that class. 
              Next, define the class "Server" and set it to extend "_Rackable", then "Router" and set it to extend "_Rackable".
          </p>

                <h3>Users</h3>
                <p>Users can be created with standard permissions or as administrators. Administrators have full access to the system, while
                    standard users can only edit CIs and relationships. Keep the number of administrators to a minimum.
